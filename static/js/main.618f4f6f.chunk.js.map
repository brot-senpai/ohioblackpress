The estimate numbers turned out not ambitious enough because the actual payment from the subscribers fell too short to continue to publish the <i>Palladium of Liberty.</i> Nevertheless, the <i>Palladium of Liberty</i> was read by a variety of groups, as the newspaper covered a wide range of topics centering issues on contemporary African American experiences and interests.</span></span>\n                <br />\n                <br /><span ><span >Since the newspaper had a strong network of agents, its subscribers were dispersed mostly across Ohio.

For example, a letter from a person named S.H.B in Wooster says, &ldquo;Seeing that many of my colored friends are engaged in writing for your paper, and I being a regular subscriber, thought it not but right that I should send you, a line or two. . .

For examples, the Female Union Sewing Society was frequently announced to have a weekly meeting: &ldquo;The Female Union Sewing Society will meet this evening, at Mr. D.

This interactive map below indicates that the <i>Palladium of Liberty</i> used at least 62 periodicals for its sources. These periodicals include other contemporary black newspapers like Peter Clark&rsquo;s <i>Disfranchised American</i> and Martin Delany&rsquo;s <i>The Mystery</i>, in addition to nationally well-known newspapers like <i>New York Sun </i>and <i>Morning Courier and New York Enquirer</i>.

We can assume that the agents would not only recruit subscribers but also delivered to the editors various periodicals that they could obtain from subscribers and local acquaintances. Notably, the <i>Palladium of Liberty</i> also cited southern prints that blatantly revealed its pro-slavery agenda, in order to criticize their hypocrisy and immorality. The fact that the editor of the <i>Palladium of Liberty </i>obtained these southern periodicals hints at the newspaper team&rsquo;s effort to maintain its credibility by offering various sources for its articles.</span></span>\n            <br />\n            <br /><span ><span >The <i>Palladium of Liberty</i> focused on contemporary politics beyond abolitionism and slavery. One of the most frequently mentioned topics is the annexation of Texas. In 1843, President John Tyler without being aligned with any political party, decided to pursue the annexation of Texas. Through secret negotiations with the Houston administration, Tyler secured a treaty of annexation in April 1844, which became public immediately. Accordingly, pro-Texas-annexation southern Democratic delegates in alliance with pro-expansion northern Democrats nominated James K. Polk for the 1844 presidential election. In the issue on April 17, 1844 David Jenkins cited former President Andrew Jackson&rsquo;s letter for the support of the annexation, so that the newspaper could unhesitatingly criticize his proslavery and Manifest Destiny platform. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span>\n            <blockquote>\n            <p><span ><span >The design of this [Jackson&rsquo;s] letter is as foul as the bottomless pit, although it was written by one that has feasted at the public shrine, and enjoyed much of the loaves and fishes of our government be thinks now that he has a right to instruct the officers of the government.&nbsp; . . .

According to the letter from W. Gassaway and G. Reynolds, who continuously attended the state conventions of colored citizens in mid-19<sup>th</sup> century Ohio, black and white residents in Zanesville gathered at the African Methodist Episcopal Church in the presence of David Jenkins. Jenkins raised a question about the Constitution and Statue from 1802 to the present legislature. At the meeting, they discussed &ldquo;the different bearings of those oppressive enactments against us as colored citizens [such as] removing from us our elective power, making no arrangements for the education f our children, denying us the proper source of justice in Courts, and collecting a tax off of us without giving us the benefit as other citizens.&rdquo;<a name=\"_ednref2\" title=\"\" style={{color:\"#0563c1\", textDecoration:\"underline\"}} target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"#_edn2\"><span className=\"MsoEndnoteReference\" style={{verticalAlign:\"super\"}}><span className=\"MsoEndnoteReference\" style={{verticalAlign:\"super\"}}><span ><span >[ii]</span></span></span></span></a> In particular, although education of black children and voting right were priority for early black communities in Ohio to ascertain their civil rights, the state law prevented them from exercising the rights while imposing taxes on African Americans.

The self-liberated people like Henry Bibb was also invited to testimony his experience under slavery and liberation, as the newspaper reported on August 14, 1844: &ldquo;On last Monday evening at the Baptist church, Mr. Bibb, a fugitive from slavery, lectured on the subject of slavery. The house was crowded to overflowing.

Many letters to the editors published in the <i>Palladium of Liberty</i> suggest that black Ohioans in general objected the idea of African colonization and emigration. One article says: &ldquo;But must we go to African and leave all those that we have mentioned; as they may become content with these conclusions, no never, no never, who under heavens has placed us in our condition, who has torn us from our original homes, and now with a live branch of slavery, as this is the best name we can give it, reaching across the Atlantic ocean, biding us welcome to a land that flows with milk and honey[?]&rdquo;<a name=\"_ednref5\" title=\"\" style={{color:\"#0563c1\", textDecoration:\"underline\"}} target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"#_edn5\"><span className=\"MsoEndnoteReference\" style={{verticalAlign:\"super\"}}><span className=\"MsoEndnoteReference\" style={{verticalAlign:\"super\"}}><span ><span >[v]</span></span></span></span></a></span></span>\n            <br />\n            <br /><span ><span >Alongside with politics, the newspaper weighed literary pieces significantly. The first pages of most issues include poems or short stories. While poems carry themes of Christian faith, morality, virtue, and freedom, short stories address the possible interest of young and women readers because they portray a young couple&rsquo;s love story and courtship, romance of a young black woman and marriage, and a young man&rsquo;s fantasy about a woman&rsquo;s virtue. These fictions were published under unidentifiable writers because of their pseudonyms like &ldquo;W.H. Carpenter&rdquo; and &ldquo;Wm. Comstock.&rdquo; One pseudonym is particularly noticeable: from the 21<sup>st</sup> issue, the newspaper published a series of &ldquo;Liberty Hymns,&rdquo; written by &ldquo;A. Freedomite.&rdquo;</span></span>\n            <br />\n            <br /><span ><span >Given that the themes and tones of these literary pieces seemed targeted at women audiences, especially black women, we may assume that the pseudonymous writers could be women writers who were associated with the editors of the <i>Palladium of Liberty</i>. [See one example of a black woman&rsquo;s love story. Figure 15.] For instance, the role of David Jenkins&rsquo; wife, Lucy Ann Jenkins does not appear apparently in the newspaper. Nevertheless, she could serve as a recruiter of local women writers, as black women often had meetings under the domestic-concerned name such as a &ldquo;sewing club&rdquo; at her residency. Otherwise, Lucy Ann Jenkins could offer her own writings, while aiding her husband&rsquo;s editorial work.</span></span>\n            <br />\n            <br /><ImageViewer image={fig_15} width={400}/> \n            <br /><span ><span >[Figure 15. &ldquo;A Fine Story,&rdquo; <i>Palladium of Liberty</i>, March 27, 1844, page 1.

We can speculate that there was a story about a young girl whose writing had been circulated and complimented among the black community in Columbus. At one sewing meeting of black women, they agreed that the young poet&rsquo;s piece was worth sharing with the editors. Although women&rsquo;s presence in the public&mdash;even in print&mdash;could hardly be approved in the cult of the 19<sup>th</sup>-century &ldquo;True Womanhood,&rdquo; the <i>Palladium of Liberty</i> allowed the young woman writer to take the public platform to show her literary talent. Despite the absence of her name, the poet&rsquo;s voice was heard. Here is her poem [Figure 16].</span></span>\n            <br />\n            <br /><ImageViewer image={fig_16} width={250}/> \n            <br /><span ><span >[Figure 16. &ldquo;Spring Verses,&rdquo; <i>Palladium of Liberty</i>, June 12, 1844, page 3. <a style={{color:\"#0563c1\", textDecoration:\"underline\"}} target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://digital-collections.columbuslibrary.org/digital/collection/african/id/25942/rec/17\">https://digital-collections.columbuslibrary.org/digital/collection/african/id/25942/rec/17</a>]</span></span>\n            <br /><span ><span ><i></i></span></span>\n            <br /><span ><span >The literary pieces, published in the <i>Palladium of Liberty</i>, seemed to be widely appreciated beyond the black community in Columbus.

Although Ohio was a free state, black communities in the state constantly experienced racial hatred, discriminatory practices, and harassments in addition to the state&rsquo;s legalization of the black law against new black residents from other states. For example, the newspaper reported on racial discrimination in public transportation where black people were ordered out of the State Coach (July 3, 1844). In another case, black people in Columbus were barred from white-owned stores (&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t Stop,&rdquo; August 28, 1844). Furthermore, black property owners often became the target of white mobs&rsquo; attack, according to the issue published on April 10, an article, &ldquo;More Barnburners!&rdquo; Even if lynching did not happen with the same frequency as that in the South, black people were often attached by whites, which were barely investigated by the authority. The newspaper on April 3, 1844, reported on a black man&rsquo;s death in an article, titled &ldquo;Outrage and Death&rdquo; [Figure 17]. According to the article, a black man was attached and beaten to death by three &ldquo;ruffians,&rdquo; but the justice system did not perform justice for black people: &ldquo;This man had one of his own color with him but what does this avail within we are deprived of justice in the courts of law and equity[?]&rdquo;</span></span>\n            <br />\n            <br /><ImageViewer image={fig_17} width={250}/> \n            <br /><span ><span >[Figure 17. &ldquo;Outrage and Death,&rdquo; <i>Palladium of Liberty</i>, April 3, 1844, page 3. <a style={{color:\"#0563c1\", textDecoration:\"underline\"}} target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://digital-collections.columbuslibrary.org/digital/collection/african/id/25900/rec/7\">https://digital-collections.columbuslibrary.org/digital/collection/african/id/25900/rec/7</a>]</span></span>\n            <br />\n            <br /><span ><span >As Ohio neighbors Kentucky and Virginia, both of which were slave states, the <i>Palladium of Liberty</i> suggests that black communities in Ohio still experienced the danger of slavery not only because they actively participated in the Underground Railroad to help self-liberated people from slave states, but also because active agents of slavery freely came to Ohio to &ldquo;hunt&rdquo; for former slaves and their allies. Along with articles on antislavery movements and illegal slave trades, the newspaper warned of slave hunters, who could be both black and white, as one article &ldquo;Look Out&rdquo; on May 15 suggests [Figure 18]. In another case, the black community in Columbus had a man, self-claimed fugitive slave, who turned out to be a slave hunter himself or at least attempted to dismantle black Ohioan&rsquo;s communal effort to build a strong community (&ldquo;Public Meeting,&rdquo; October 23, 1844).</span></span>\n            <br />\n            <br /><ImageViewer image={fig_18} width={300}/> \n            <br /><span ><span >[Figure 18. &ldquo;Look Out,&rdquo; <i>Palladium of Liberty</i>, May 15, 1844, page 3. <a style={{color:\"#0563c1\", textDecoration:\"underline\"}} target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://digital-collections.columbuslibrary.org/digital/collection/african/id/25927/rec/13\">https://digital-collections.columbuslibrary.org/digital/collection/african/id/25927/rec/13</a>]</span></span>\n            <br />\n            <br /><span ><span >Another shadow of slavery over Ohio can be seen in advertisements to look for lost family members.

Just like the newspaper was a product of the 1843 national convention in Buffalo, New York, the editors organized groups of leaders, donors, participants, and volunteers for the 1844 state convention, which was held in Columbus, in September. For example, the newspaper ran an advertisement for Ladies&rsquo; Bazaar to fund the events at the convention, as Figure 8 illustrates (&ldquo;Who Read the <i>Palladium of Liberty </i>in the 1840s?&rdquo;). While we witness the state convention through the proceedings and minutes that report what happened inside of the convention, the <i>Palladium of Liberty</i> demonstrates how black people celebrated the communal action for black citizenship in addition to the convention meeting itself. David Jenkins and other committee members of the state convention planned for a rally outside of the convention site, and this announcement appeared more than five months till the convention took place on September 18<sup>th. </sup>[Figure 19]</span></span>\n            <br />\n            <br /><ImageViewer image={fig_19} width={250}/> \n            <br /><span ><span >[Figure 19. &ldquo;The Grand Rally,&rdquo; the <i>Palladium of Liberty</i>, April 10, 1844, page 3. <a style={{color:\"#0563c1\", textDecoration:\"underline\"}} target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://digital-collections.columbuslibrary.org/digital/collection/african/id/25904/rec/3\">https://digital-collections.columbuslibrary.org/digital/collection/african/id/25904/rec/3</a>] &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span>\n            <br />\n            <br /><span ><span >Celebrations of black history and community building were not limited to conventions of African Americans.

By contrast to their enthusiasm for the independence of the West Indies, it is notable that the newspaper remained quite about the Independence Day of the U.S., the Fourth of July. According to the newspaper, black citizens in Ohio held the celebration of the Emancipation of the West Indies at least in three cities: Harveysburg, Columbus, and Newark in 1844. After the celebration, the <i>Palladium of Liberty</i> reported on the one in Columbus: &ldquo;Elder Shelton, then proceeded to address the people on the great subject of emancipation which took place in the British West India Islands, on the first day of August in the year of our Lord 1838, at which time eight hundred thousand of our fellow beings were set at liberty.&rdquo;

Jenkins was listed as &ldquo;painter&rdquo; in the Columbus&rsquo;s city directories 1848, 1862-1872 and in the 1850, 1860 and 1870 Census. But his work exceeded &ldquo;painting,&rdquo; but was extended to large-scaled construction. For example, the exclusive Neil House hotel, whose construction Jenkins and his workers built, in Columbus demonstrated architectural achievements in the 19<sup>th</sup> century, and served Ohioans&rsquo; public gatherings for a long time.</span></span>\n            <br />\n            <br /><ImageViewer image={neil_house} width={400}/> \n            <br /><span ><span >[Figure 3.

Collins assumes that he might have accepted a position in Mississippi with the Freeman&rsquo;s Bureau or intended to improve the Southern city according to his Northern ideas, but no evidence proves either.

DH tools are essential to this research and publication because quantitative methods with data and digital visualization can make visible what, like early black communities in the Midwest, has been considered hard to trace. This project offers informative and interpretative essays through both close and distance reading of the newspapers to show dynamic communal life of 19th-century black Ohioans, who legitimized their sovereignty by demonstrating civic qualification as a response to and beyond the government system that had failed to maintain its constitutional promise on human rights. The project serves as a tool for civic education by offering accessible digital resource for the learning public, in order to promote a better understanding of the maturation of American democracy and the use of DH tools for equity.\n        </div>\n    )\n}","import React from 'react';\n\n\n\nexport default function(){\n    \n    return(\n        <div>\n            acknowledgements\n        </div>\n    )\n}","import React from 'react';\n\n\n\nexport default function(){\n    \n    return(\n        <div>\n            This project uses all the extant copies from 18 remaining periodicals in 19th-century Ohio. They are obtained from archives hosted at Columbus Metropolitan Library, Western Reserve Historical Society, Cincinnati History Library and Archives, and Ohio History Connection. They as well as research-based introduction and analysis are offered digitally, and most of them are transcribed manually and digitally through optical character recognition (OCR). This digital publication can let readers observe early black Ohioans’ dynamic collaboration to produce newspapers through digitized archives, interactive maps, and graphs. As an effort to avoid oversimplification of data mined from mostly limited extant copies of the newspapers, interactive maps and graphs will allow readers to explore detailed information through links to relevant pages within the project, and to move in and out of the project site for their own interest. This design for readers’ independent learning through flexible pathways imitates how early African Americans practiced ideals of democracy in mundane experience. As the black newspapers in 19th-century Ohio prove, they strategically decentered and centered to democratize the way of organizing their communities. In exploring this project, readers can experience this process as well because its digital publication allows readers to learn for their own need through multidirectional pathways.\n        </div>\n    )\n}","import React from \"react\";\r\nimport { makeStyles } from \"@material-ui/core/styles\";\r\nimport GridItem from \"components/Grid/GridItem.js\";\r\nimport GridContainer from \"components/Grid/GridContainer.js\";\r\n\r\nimport CustomTabs from \"components/CustomTabs/CustomTabs.js\";\r\n\r\nimport styles from \"assets/jss/material-dashboard-react/views/dashboardStyle.js\";\r\n\r\n\r\nconst useStyles = makeStyles(styles);\r\n\r\nexport default function Introduction(){\r\n    const classes = useStyles();\r\n    return(\r\n        \r\n        <div>\r\n            <GridContainer>\r\n                <GridItem xs={12} sm={12} md={12}>\r\n                    <CustomTabs\r\n                        className={classes.cardTitleWhite}\r\n                        title=\"\"\r\n                        headerColor=\"info\"\r\n                        tabs={[\r\n                        {\r\n                            tabName: \"About\",                          \r\n                            \r\n                        },\r\n                        {\r\n                            tabName: \"Sources and Methods\",                            \r\n                            \r\n                        },\r\n                        {\r\n                            tabName: \"Acknowledgement\",                                                     \r\n                            \r\n                        }\r\n                        ]}\r\n                    />\r\n                </GridItem>\r\n                {/* <GridItem xs={12} sm={12} md={12}>\r\n                    <Card>\r\n                        <CardHeader color=\"info\">\r\n                        <h4 className={classes.cardTitleWhite}>Sources and Methods</h4>\r\n                        <p className={classes.cardCategoryWhite}>\r\n                            \r\n                        </p>\r\n                        </CardHeader>\r\n                        <CardBody>\r\n                            Something about us\r\n                        </CardBody>\r\n                    </Card>\r\n                </GridItem>\r\n                <GridItem xs={12} sm={12} md={12}>\r\n                    <Card>\r\n                        <CardHeader color=\"info\">\r\n                        <h4 className={classes.cardTitleWhite}>Acknowledgement</h4>\r\n                        <p className={classes.cardCategoryWhite}>\r\n                            \r\n                        </p>\r\n                        </CardHeader>\r\n                        <CardBody>\r\n                            {ack}\r\n                        </CardBody>\r\n                    </Card>\r\n                </GridItem> */}\r\n            </GridContainer>\r\n            \r\n        </div>\r\n        \r\n    )\r\n}","import React from \"react\";\r\nimport { makeStyles } from \"@material-ui/core/styles\";\r\n\r\nimport GridItem from \"components/Grid/GridItem.js\";\r\nimport GridContainer from \"components/Grid/GridContainer.js\";\r\n\r\nimport Card from \"components/Card/Card.js\";\r\nimport CardHeader from \"components/Card/CardHeader.js\";\r\n//import CardBody from \"components/Card/CardBody.js\";\r\n\r\nimport styles from \"assets/jss/material-dashboard-react/views/dashboardStyle.js\";\r\n\r\nconst useStyles = makeStyles(styles);\r\n\r\nexport default function Exhibits(){\r\n    const classes = useStyles();\r\n    return(\r\n        <div>\r\n            <GridContainer>\r\n                <GridItem xs={12} sm={12} md={12}>\r\n                    <Card>\r\n                        <CardHeader color=\"warning\">\r\n                        <h4 className={classes.cardTitleWhite}>Annexation of Texas (1844-45)</h4>\r\n                        <p className={classes.cardCategoryWhite}>                            \r\n                        </p>\r\n                        </CardHeader>\r\n                    </Card>\r\n                </GridItem>\r\n                <GridItem xs={12} sm={12} md={12}>\r\n                    <Card>\r\n                        <CardHeader color=\"warning\">\r\n                        <h4 className={classes.cardTitleWhite}>Dred Scott v.
