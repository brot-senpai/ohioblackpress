They are obtained from archives hosted at Columbus Metropolitan Library, Western Reserve Historical Society, Cincinnati History Library and Archives, and Ohio History Connection. They as well as research-based introduction and analysis are offered digitally, and most of them are transcribed manually and digitally through optical character recognition (OCR). This digital publication can let readers observe early black Ohioans’ dynamic collaboration to produce newspapers through digitized archives, interactive maps, and graphs. As an effort to avoid oversimplification of data mined from mostly limited extant copies of the newspapers, interactive maps and graphs will allow readers to explore detailed information through links to relevant pages within the project, and to move in and out of the project site for their own interest. This design for readers’ independent learning through flexible pathways imitates how early African Americans practiced ideals of democracy in mundane experience. As the black newspapers in 19th-century Ohio prove, they strategically decentered and centered to democratize the way of organizing their communities. In exploring this project, readers can experience this process as well because its digital publication allows readers to learn for their own need through multidirectional pathways."
